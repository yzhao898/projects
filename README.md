## Online Retail Conversion Rate Prediction

This project predicts the conversion rate using the data about all users who hit a certain site: whether they converted or not as well as some of their characteristics such as their country, the marketing channel, their age, whether they are repeat users and the number of pages visited during that session (as a proxy for site activity/time spent on site). Finally, I come up with recommendations for the product team and the marketing team to improve conversion rate after analyzing the prediction results.

## Airbnb Price Pridiction

This project analyzes the Los Angeles Airbnb listing price (variable price). It is the most recent data downloaded from Inside Airbnb. I worked with several sorts of categorical variables, including those that contain way too many too small categories. I also build 4 regression models and interpret the results.
